<body>Hey there,<br>
<br>
before using this bot you should know that it is based on the <a href="https://warpmymind.com/index.php?gadget=HFiles&action=GetFile&file_id=462">email slave</a> file by EMG. This bot is meant to send commands upon receiving a mail requesting commands.<br>
<br>
To get instructions about how to use this bot, just send a mail with 'help' in the subject or the body to the bot. Be sure to always write a <b>new</b> mail instead of answering the bot mails, since that can lead to undesired behavior.<br>
<br>
Also please feel free to send feedback or ideas for commands to me, I'm happy about all your messages :)<br>
<br>
Cheers, and be safe<br>
The bot-creator :)<br>

<br>
I'm a bot designed to give you commands after you listened to the <a href="https://warpmymind.com/index.php?gadget=HFiles&action=GetFile&file_id=462">email slave</a> file by EMG.<br>
<br>
To receive commands from me, just send me a <b>new</b> mail with the subject "I want <i>x</i> commands", where 'x' is the amount of commands you want to get (please write <b>digits</b>, i'm bad at reading). In the email body select the caterogies of commands you want to receive. If you want the file to include "must do", write "I <b>need</b> <i>x</i> commands".<br>
(Every command will only be included once, so don't worry if you get less commands than you wanted, it might just be all commands i have to offer currently)<br>
<br>
Be sure to select <b>at least one</b> category, otherwise you will receive no commands! Every command has to be in a <b>new line</b> (If two categories are in the same line, both categories will be ignored).<br>
<br>
The categories are:<br>
{}
<br>
Enjoy your time, and be safe :)<br>
Cheers,<br>

I'm sorry that I couldn't answer your mail right away, I was feeling a bit down and needed a break. And for safety reasons I won't give you commands right now, who knows where you are right now.<br>

If you get this mail though I should be online again, so feel free to send me a new mail :)<br>

<br>
I couldn't generate commands for you. Did you read the instructions carefully?<br>
<br>
Common mistakes are not giving body parts for body-writing or not selecting the category in the right way (you only need to name the category, no extra words).<br>
